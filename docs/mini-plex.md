The search for academic papers on anti-drone technology has yielded several relevant results. One notable paper, titled "Research on anti UAV swarm system in prevention of the important place," discusses the development of an anti-UAV swarm system aimed at protecting critical locations. This paper highlights the evolving combat characteristics of UAV swarms, noting their increasing intelligence and the significant threats they pose. It argues that traditional single-mode anti-UAV technologies are insufficient against the coordinated nature of a swarm, proposing instead a comprehensive "Anti UAV Swarm System (AUSS)." The research also differentiates between UAV formation, cluster, and swarm, emphasizing the unique characteristics of a swarm, such as large numbers, wide distribution, and high autonomy. The paper concludes by suggesting that while Russia showed limited success against a UAV swarm in 2019, a more sophisticated system is necessary for effective defense [Qi Hao et al. (2020) Research on anti UAV swarm system in prevention of the important place](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1507/5/052020).

Another paper, "Antidrone Wireless Personal Shield," describes a personal shield against small, uncontrolled drones. It discusses vulnerabilities in 802.11 wireless network protocols that allow for targeted cyber-attacks on drones. The proposed solution involves using a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to a power bank to create a "denial-of-service" attack against the drone's wireless communication by forging disassociation and deauthentication packets. This approach is noted for its portability and for avoiding disruption to other networks, unlike more disruptive countermeasures [M. Ivanciu and Marian Alexandru (2021) Antidrone Wireless Personal Shield](https://webbut.unitbv.ro/index.php/Series_I/article/view/13/2).

The paper "Development of UAV Tracing and Coordinate Detection Method Using a Dual-Axis Rotary Platform for an Anti-UAV System" proposes a method for automatically tracing and detecting the coordinates of UAVs. It utilizes a dual-axis rotary platform combined with visual image processing to track drones' movements. Additionally, it employs a nine-axis attitude meter and laser rangers to determine altitude and calculate longitude/latitude coordinates. The system's effectiveness was tested using a DJI MAVIC UAV under various conditions, showing promising results during both daytime and nighttime, though thermal imaging cameras were found to be susceptible to interference from black clouds [Bor-Horng Sheu et al. (2019) Development of UAV Tracing and Coordinate Detection Method Using a Dual-Axis Rotary Platform for an Anti-UAV System](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/13/2583).

Lastly, "Anti-drone Sensors, Effectors, and Systems – A Concise Overview" provides a broad overview of anti-drone technologies. It discusses the increasing use of drones and the subsequent development of counter-drone systems (C-UAS) to protect critical infrastructure, government facilities, and mass events. The paper also addresses the potential interference of some counter-drone effectors with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and notes the growing market for anti-drone technology and its research and development [Dariusz Zmysłowski et al. (2023) Anti-drone Sensors, Effectors, and Systems – A Concise Overview](https://www.transnav.eu/Article_Anti-drone_Sensors,_Effectors,_Zmys%c5%82owski,66,1318.html).

These papers collectively provide a comprehensive view of the current state of anti-drone technology, from personal shields to sophisticated systems designed to counter UAV swarms, highlighting both the challenges and the advancements in this field.
