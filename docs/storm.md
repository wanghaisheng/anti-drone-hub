RF scanning has the possibility of missing a drone or two, as aircraft that have been designed to fly on their own may not be sending or receiving RF transmissions from a pilot or base station. Electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors can be used to detect drones depending on their visual and heat signatures. These sensors may need to be paired with machine vision and artificial intelligence algorithms that can reduce the risk of false positives and negatives.

Advanced solutions employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and response times. Countermeasures such as jamming, spoofing, and kinetic interception are used to disable or capture rogue drones.Mitigation systems neutralize unauthorized drones using various methods. Jamming systems emit radio frequency signals to disrupt the communication link between a drone and its operator, causing the drone to lose control. Spoofing systems send false GPS signals, confusing the drone and redirecting its flight path. Kinetic interception uses projectiles, nets, or anti-drone guns to physically disable or capture drones. Directed energy systems, like high-powered lasers or microwave weapons, disable drones by damaging their electronics.

These basic jammers could be unsafe for the user. Their effectiveness is also uncertain. While signal jamming has been used since WWII, neutralizing drones today requires advanced technology. This includes sophisticated waveform and antenna design, effective jamming signals, and good heat dissipation.
Due to various issues affecting the Russian military-industrial sector, including degradation and compromises, Russian military systems often rely on imported commercial components. For instance, critical hardware in Orlan-10 drones incorporates components from China, Europe, and the U.S. Counter drone systems such as those by DroneShield, which are designed for commercial drones and components, are expected to be very effective in detecting and neutralizing such threats.Detection systems, utilizing various technologies, serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized drones by identifying them in specific areas. Radar-based systems use radio waves to detect and locate drones, providing real-time information about their position, speed, and altitude. These systems can distinguish between drones and other objects, such as birds, minimizing false alarms. RF detection systems monitor the radio frequencies used for drone communication and control. By analyzing these signals, they can identify drones and determine the location of their operators, particularly effective against commercially available drones using standard communication protocols.

The evolution of anti-drone systems has been driven by both military needs and civilian applications. Early developments primarily aimed at military forces involved basic radar and jamming technologies to counter enemy drones. However, as the technology has advanced, so have the strategies employed to neutralize drone threats. Modern anti-drone systems incorporate a variety of detection methods—such as radar, radio frequency scanners, and optical sensors—alongside mitigation technologies like jamming, spoofing, and kinetic interception, highlighting a multifaceted approach to drone defense.<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[4]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [4]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The Technical and Legal Challenges of Anti-Drone Systems </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666" target="_blank">https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>Most anti-drone systems combine several technologies such as radar for detection and optical camera for identification. Furthermore, many systems only work on the mainstream consumer drones and are totally ineffective against homemade platforms that fall out the range of traditional radio frequency (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz) and guidance systems (direct link versus autonomous flight). Unfortunately, building a custom drone is relatively easy and does not require advanced technical knowledge. Legally, the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (NDAA) in December 2016 which gives authority to the Secretary of Defense to implement anti-drone measures to protect strategic military locations.Usually these different technologies are combined to offer detection and identification capabilities. Radar is well suited for detection while optical and infrared imaging give the operator a direct view of the object in order to confirm or dismiss the threat.
Neutralization: Destruction Versus Jamming- The Communications Act of 1934 “requires persons operating or using radio transmitters to be licensed or authorized under the Commission’s rules.” (47 U.S.C. § 301)
- The 47 C.F.R. Section 2.803 of the FCC “prohibits the manufacture, importation, marketing, sale or operation of these devices within the United States.”
- The U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. Section 1362) also “prohibits willful or malicious interference to U.S. government communications; subjects the operator to possible fines, imprisonment, or both.” This section could be applied to the GPS jammers.
Conclusion: The Level of Threat Versus Fear-MongeringThe first challenge is to detect and identify the threat. The difference between detection and identification is related to the level of accuracy and certainty. Detection is the ability to find and alert the presence of a threat. Identification is the capacity to classify the nature of the threat. For instance, the motion detection sensor of a home security system can detect a movement coming from a pet, a flapping window, or a person. Beyond that initial detection phase, the owner will need to check the security camera to identify the nature of the alarm: is this a cat or an intruder?
Below are the main detection and identification technologies.
Optical and InfraredUnfortunately, jamming is not operative against autonomous drones which follow pre-programmed routes via GPS waypoints (e.g., Pixhawk). Moreover, many custom-made drones can be fitted with different radio frequencies (72 Mhz, 433 MHz, 800/900 MHz, 1.2/1.3 GHz, etc.) to escape the scope of the drone guns. Jamming the GPS can be effective unless the drone is equipped with an inertial navigation system which allows the aircraft to navigate autonomously without the help external signals.
The Legal Issues
The jamming procedure is not exempt of problems due to its poor selectivity. Jamming also affects legitimate systems in the area as the FAA noted on October 2016 in a letter sent to airports:
Unauthorized UAS detection and counter measure deployments can create a host of problems, such as electromagnetic and Radio Frequency (RF) interference affecting safety of flight and air traffic management issues.</p></div></div></div><div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[5]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [5]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Feature Article: S&amp;T Tests Cutting-Edge Counter-Drone Technology </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/02/27/feature-article-st-tests-cutting-edge-counter-drone-technology" target="_blank">https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/02/27/feature-article-st-tests-cutting-edge-counter-drone-technology</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>With such promising evaluations completed and initial findings in hand, S&amp;T and its partners are looking forward to what’s next. “We are analyzing results from both events to determine future testing needs and where R&amp;D investments should be made,” said S&amp;T Program Manager Shawn McDonald.

In July, the Army announced a $13 million award to Leonardo DRS to continue engineering and testing of the Mobile Low, Slow UAV Integrated Defense System (MLIDS). In October 2017, the company was awarded a $43 million production contract for an undisclosed number of MLIDS to meet the Army’s need to counter small, inexpensive UAVs — such as commercial quadcopters — operating as airborne improvised explosive devices (IEDs).</p></div></div></div>
Controversies surrounding anti-drone measures often stem from the balance between national security and civil liberties. Legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 has provided a legal framework for implementing anti-drone technologies; however, ongoing debates regarding privacy rights and regulatory challenges complicate the landscape. As public and private entities continue to explore the implications of drone technology, the integration of anti-drone systems into existing security protocols remains a critical concern for policymakers and stakeholders.<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[3]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [3]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Defending Airspace: How Anti-Drone Systems Are Changing the Security ... </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/resource-center/trends-and-outlook/aerospace-and-defence/defending-airspace-anti-drone-systems-security-landscape" target="_blank">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/resource-center/trends-and-outlook/aerospace-and-defence/defending-airspace-anti-drone-systems-security-landscape</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>Anti-drone technology encompasses a range of systems designed to detect, track, and neutralize unauthorized drones.

If so, what limitations and requirements should be placed on them? If not, how can CUAS capabilities be extended to such facilities?Department of Justice. There are abundant federal statutes and regulations that may conceivably apply to drone operations, ranging from the federal criminal statutes and civil rights laws to anti-hacking and privacy laws. But none apparently grant the Bureau of Prisons or the other law enforcement agencies within the DOJ—the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Marshals, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives—an exemption from otherwise applicable laws that restrict hostile drone interdiction. And it is unclear which, if any, technologies are most appropriate for implementation in law enforcement CUAS activities.REF. These incidents, as well as others, including unauthorized flights over sports stadiums and in controlled airspace near airports—and even a crash onto the White House lawnREF—have exposed both the vulnerability of sensitive facilities and critical infrastructure to hostile or recklessly operated UAS, and serious shortcomings in the capabilities of law enforcement and national security agencies to address these threats.- Use best practices and lessons to broaden the pilot into a national program. Upon the conclusion of this pilot program, the DHS, in consultation with the FAA and DOJ, should issue a report documenting the findings of the pilot and the best path forward for CUAS authorities and technologies to be made more widely available to law enforcement and critical infrastructure operators. This report must answer several critical questions regarding the future of CUAS authorities and use:
- Is the delegated-authority model the correct model for a nationwide expansion of the program?
- Using a risk-based analysis, what types of critical infrastructure and other facilities are most likely to need CUAS defenses? Should different types of facilities be limited to certain types of CUAS? And how should CUAS operators and platforms communicate with each other?Some hope that current Justice Department policies and U.S. Supreme Court case law would shield from liability any law enforcement officer who did have to act to protect himself and the public by interdicting a hostile drone, provided he did so in an objectively reasonable manner. But current law does not provide adequate certainty to ensure appropriate CUAS actions are taken if and when necessary. Congress must provide appropriate CUAS authorities for federal law enforcement agencies.REF
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Federal Communications Commission is an independent agency that regulates the nation’s interstate cable, radio, satellite, television, and wire communications infrastructure. Several federal laws and regulations prohibit operating, marketing, or selling signal “jamming” devices that have been recognized as potential CUAS tools because they interfere with cellular communications, radar, global positioning systems, and wireless networking services.REFPerhaps the most critical role played by the FAA in the CUAS context will be its responsibility to set and enforce flight restrictions designed to protect special events and sensitive operations such as the Super Bowl, certain law enforcement activities, and presidential movement.REF These flight restrictions also apply to UAS, and in recent months the agency has established a series of “no drone zones” around national monuments and other sites. These restrictions may serve as the core of future CUAS activities, defining the regions within which only authorized drone traffic will be permitted.

58 Counter–Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Strategy.Doctrinal discussions also include debates on roles and missions, especially in the air defense of air bases. The wars in Vietnam and Iraq forced senior military commanders and the Services to allocate capabilities to traditional missions at the expense of defense of air bases supporting strategic and operational objectives.56 The Army and Air Force especially have wrestled over specific roles in area and point air defense missions since the end of World War II. A 2020 RAND study highlighted the current debate:
Today, the U.S. Army is responsible for providing point AMD [air and missile defense] for Air Force bases and other fixed facilities, but years of neglect from both services have resulted in capability and capacity shortfalls. . . .

Anti-drone technology is employed to protect areas such as airports, critical infrastructure, and large public spaces such as stadiums, military installations, and battlefield sites. The presence of rogue drones can be detected by a plethora of methods.</p></div></div></div>.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 mb-2 text-primary" id="early-developments">Early Developments</h2>
<p class="text-lg">The inception of anti-drone measures can be traced back to the early 2000s, as military forces recognized the growing capabilities of drones on the battlefield. Initial responses were predominantly focused on detecting and neutralizing threats posed by enemy UAVs. This period saw the introduction of basic radar systems and jamming technologies designed to disrupt the communication links between drones and their operators<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[4]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [4]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The Technical and Legal Challenges of Anti-Drone Systems </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666" target="_blank">https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>Most anti-drone systems combine several technologies such as radar for detection and optical camera for identification. Furthermore, many systems only work on the mainstream consumer drones and are totally ineffective against homemade platforms that fall out the range of traditional radio frequency (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz) and guidance systems (direct link versus autonomous flight). Unfortunately, building a custom drone is relatively easy and does not require advanced technical knowledge. Legally, the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (NDAA) in December 2016 which gives authority to the Secretary of Defense to implement anti-drone measures to protect strategic military locations.Usually these different technologies are combined to offer detection and identification capabilities. Radar is well suited for detection while optical and infrared imaging give the operator a direct view of the object in order to confirm or dismiss the threat.
Neutralization: Destruction Versus Jamming- The Communications Act of 1934 “requires persons operating or using radio transmitters to be licensed or authorized under the Commission’s rules.” (47 U.S.C. § 301)
- The 47 C.F.R. Section 2.803 of the FCC “prohibits the manufacture, importation, marketing, sale or operation of these devices within the United States.”
- The U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. Section 1362) also “prohibits willful or malicious interference to U.S. government communications; subjects the operator to possible fines, imprisonment, or both.” This section could be applied to the GPS jammers.
Conclusion: The Level of Threat Versus Fear-MongeringThe first challenge is to detect and identify the threat. The difference between detection and identification is related to the level of accuracy and certainty. Detection is the ability to find and alert the presence of a threat. Identification is the capacity to classify the nature of the threat. For instance, the motion detection sensor of a home security system can detect a movement coming from a pet, a flapping window, or a person. Beyond that initial detection phase, the owner will need to check the security camera to identify the nature of the alarm: is this a cat or an intruder?
Below are the main detection and identification technologies.
Optical and InfraredUnfortunately, jamming is not operative against autonomous drones which follow pre-programmed routes via GPS waypoints (e.g., Pixhawk). Moreover, many custom-made drones can be fitted with different radio frequencies (72 Mhz, 433 MHz, 800/900 MHz, 1.2/1.3 GHz, etc.) to escape the scope of the drone guns. Jamming the GPS can be effective unless the drone is equipped with an inertial navigation system which allows the aircraft to navigate autonomously without the help external signals.
The Legal Issues
The jamming procedure is not exempt of problems due to its poor selectivity. Jamming also affects legitimate systems in the area as the FAA noted on October 2016 in a letter sent to airports:
Unauthorized UAS detection and counter measure deployments can create a host of problems, such as electromagnetic and Radio Frequency (RF) interference affecting safety of flight and air traffic management issues.</p></div></div></div>.</p>

These technologies are crucial for addressing security, privacy, and public safety concerns arising from the widespread use of drones. Key components include radar systems, radio frequency detectors, and optical sensors that identify drone presence. Advanced solutions employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and response times. Countermeasures such as jamming, spoofing, and kinetic interception are used to disable or capture rogue drones.Mitigation systems neutralize unauthorized drones using various methods. Jamming systems emit radio frequency signals to disrupt the communication link between a drone and its operator, causing the drone to lose control. Spoofing systems send false GPS signals, confusing the drone and redirecting its flight path. Kinetic interception uses projectiles, nets, or anti-drone guns to physically disable or capture drones. Directed energy systems, like high-powered lasers or microwave weapons, disable drones by damaging their electronics. These methods, when combined, provide a comprehensive approach to countering different types of drone threats, enhancing the protection of sensitive areas from unauthorized drone activities.The hand-held and portable jammers seen in public reports look almost homemade. These basic jammers could be unsafe for the user. Their effectiveness is also uncertain. While signal jamming has been used since WWII, neutralizing drones today requires advanced technology. This includes sophisticated waveform and antenna design, effective jamming signals, and good heat dissipation.
Due to various issues affecting the Russian military-industrial sector, including degradation and compromises, Russian military systems often rely on imported commercial components. For instance, critical hardware in Orlan-10 drones incorporates components from China, Europe, and the U.S. Counter drone systems such as those by DroneShield, which are designed for commercial drones and components, are expected to be very effective in detecting and neutralizing such threats.Detection systems, utilizing various technologies, serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized drones by identifying them in specific areas. Radar-based systems use radio waves to detect and locate drones, providing real-time information about their position, speed, and altitude. These systems can distinguish between drones and other objects, such as birds, minimizing false alarms. RF detection systems monitor the radio frequencies used for drone communication and control. By analyzing these signals, they can identify drones and determine the location of their operators, particularly effective against commercially available drones using standard communication protocols. Acoustic sensors detect the unique sounds produced by drone motors and propellers, enabling real-time detection even in challenging environments. EO/IR cameras use optical and infrared imaging to detect and visually track drones, capturing high-resolution images and videos for identification</p></div></div></div>.</p>

These technologies are crucial for addressing security, privacy, and public safety concerns arising from the widespread use of drones. Key components include radar systems, radio frequency detectors, and optical sensors that identify drone presence. Advanced solutions employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and response times. Countermeasures such as jamming, spoofing, and kinetic interception are used to disable or capture rogue drones.Mitigation systems neutralize unauthorized drones using various methods. Jamming systems emit radio frequency signals to disrupt the communication link between a drone and its operator, causing the drone to lose control. Spoofing systems send false GPS signals, confusing the drone and redirecting its flight path. Kinetic interception uses projectiles, nets, or anti-drone guns to physically disable or capture drones. Directed energy systems, like high-powered lasers or microwave weapons, disable drones by damaging their electronics. These methods, when combined, provide a comprehensive approach to countering different types of drone threats, enhancing the protection of sensitive areas from unauthorized drone activities.The hand-held and portable jammers seen in public reports look almost homemade. These basic jammers could be unsafe for the user. Their effectiveness is also uncertain. While signal jamming has been used since WWII, neutralizing drones today requires advanced technology. This includes sophisticated waveform and antenna design, effective jamming signals, and good heat dissipation.
Due to various issues affecting the Russian military-industrial sector, including degradation and compromises, Russian military systems often rely on imported commercial components. For instance, critical hardware in Orlan-10 drones incorporates components from China, Europe, and the U.S. Counter drone systems such as those by DroneShield, which are designed for commercial drones and components, are expected to be very effective in detecting and neutralizing such threats.Detection systems, utilizing various technologies, serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized drones by identifying them in specific areas. Radar-based systems use radio waves to detect and locate drones, providing real-time information about their position, speed, and altitude. These systems can distinguish between drones and other objects, such as birds, minimizing false alarms. RF detection systems monitor the radio frequencies used for drone communication and control. By analyzing these signals, they can identify drones and determine the location of their operators, particularly effective against commercially available drones using standard communication protocols. Acoustic sensors detect the unique sounds produced by drone motors and propellers, enabling real-time detection even in challenging environments. EO/IR cameras use optical and infrared imaging to detect and visually track drones, capturing high-resolution images and videos for identification</p></div></div></div><div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[5]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [5]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Feature Article: S&amp;T Tests Cutting-Edge Counter-Drone Technology </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/02/27/feature-article-st-tests-cutting-edge-counter-drone-technology" target="_blank">https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/02/27/feature-article-st-tests-cutting-edge-counter-drone-technology</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>With such promising evaluations completed and initial findings in hand, S&amp;T and its partners are looking forward to what’s next. “We are analyzing results from both events to determine future testing needs and where R&amp;D investments should be made,” said S&amp;T Program Manager Shawn McDonald.

The FAA plays a pivotal role by setting and enforcing flight restrictions around sensitive locations, thus defining "no drone zones" where unauthorized drone activity is prohibited.

If so, what limitations and requirements should be placed on them? If not, how can CUAS capabilities be extended to such facilities?Department of Justice. There are abundant federal statutes and regulations that may conceivably apply to drone operations, ranging from the federal criminal statutes and civil rights laws to anti-hacking and privacy laws. But none apparently grant the Bureau of Prisons or the other law enforcement agencies within the DOJ—the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Marshals, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives—an exemption from otherwise applicable laws that restrict hostile drone interdiction. And it is unclear which, if any, technologies are most appropriate for implementation in law enforcement CUAS activities.REF. These incidents, as well as others, including unauthorized flights over sports stadiums and in controlled airspace near airports—and even a crash onto the White House lawnREF—have exposed both the vulnerability of sensitive facilities and critical infrastructure to hostile or recklessly operated UAS, and serious shortcomings in the capabilities of law enforcement and national security agencies to address these threats.- Use best practices and lessons to broaden the pilot into a national program. Upon the conclusion of this pilot program, the DHS, in consultation with the FAA and DOJ, should issue a report documenting the findings of the pilot and the best path forward for CUAS authorities and technologies to be made more widely available to law enforcement and critical infrastructure operators. This report must answer several critical questions regarding the future of CUAS authorities and use:
- Is the delegated-authority model the correct model for a nationwide expansion of the program?
- Using a risk-based analysis, what types of critical infrastructure and other facilities are most likely to need CUAS defenses? Should different types of facilities be limited to certain types of CUAS? And how should CUAS operators and platforms communicate with each other?Some hope that current Justice Department policies and U.S. Supreme Court case law would shield from liability any law enforcement officer who did have to act to protect himself and the public by interdicting a hostile drone, provided he did so in an objectively reasonable manner. But current law does not provide adequate certainty to ensure appropriate CUAS actions are taken if and when necessary. Congress must provide appropriate CUAS authorities for federal law enforcement agencies.REF
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Federal Communications Commission is an independent agency that regulates the nation’s interstate cable, radio, satellite, television, and wire communications infrastructure. Several federal laws and regulations prohibit operating, marketing, or selling signal “jamming” devices that have been recognized as potential CUAS tools because they interfere with cellular communications, radar, global positioning systems, and wireless networking services.REFPerhaps the most critical role played by the FAA in the CUAS context will be its responsibility to set and enforce flight restrictions designed to protect special events and sensitive operations such as the Super Bowl, certain law enforcement activities, and presidential movement.REF These flight restrictions also apply to UAS, and in recent months the agency has established a series of “no drone zones” around national monuments and other sites. These restrictions may serve as the core of future CUAS activities, defining the regions within which only authorized drone traffic will be permitted.

Small Drones Pose Big Technology, Policy Challenges for Army
By Allyson Park

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Drones are changing the nature of modern warfare, and as small unmanned aerial systems proliferate above battlefields, the Army is focusing on developing and procuring new technology to counter them.
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George announced at the Association of the United States Army’s annual meeting and exposition in October four major areas where the service will “step on the gas” in 2025, and counter-UAS technology was at the top of the list. He called for Army formations to “dramatically improve” their ability to counter adversary unmanned systems.</p></div></div></div>.</p>

<p class="text-lg">The proliferation of small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has fundamentally altered the dynamics of modern warfare, prompting military organizations to develop counter-UAS (CUAS) technologies. A significant focus has been placed on enhancing the capabilities of the Army to counter adversary unmanned systems, as highlighted by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George in October 2023. He emphasized the need for the Army to “dramatically improve” its counter-UAS technology, identifying it as a top priority for the upcoming years<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[15]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [15]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Advancements in Anti-Aircraft Technology: A Historical Overview </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://militarysaga.com/anti-aircraft-technology/" target="_blank">https://militarysaga.com/anti-aircraft-technology/</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>These technological advancements necessitated changes in the design and manufacturing processes of ammunition. Emphasis was placed on increasing the reliability and precision of the ammunition used in anti-aircraft guns. As such, the improvement in explosives and ammunition directly enhanced overall operational effectiveness in countering aerial threats, marking a significant shift in military strategy during the war.
Training and Coordination for Anti-Aircraft Operations
Training and coordination for anti-aircraft operations during World War I were integral components in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-aircraft technology. As aerial combat became prevalent, military forces recognized the necessity of educating personnel on the intricacies of identifying, tracking, and engaging enemy aircraft.In summary, while anti-aircraft technology established a foundational framework for air defense, its efficacy was significantly constrained by technological limitations and the dynamic nature of aerial warfare. This early experience would eventually shape future innovations in defense strategies and systems in subsequent conflicts.
Success Rates Against Enemy Aircraft
The effectiveness of anti-aircraft technology during World War I can be evaluated through its success rates against enemy aircraft. These rates varied significantly depending on the type of weapon used and the tactics employed by both attackers and defenders.
Historically, anti-aircraft machine guns had limited success, primarily due to their high rate of fire but relatively low accuracy at long ranges. Statistical analysis shows that these weapons achieved only a small percentage of confirmed kills, often described as one successful engagement for every several hundred rounds fired.Soldiers were trained in the operation of various anti-aircraft weapons, including machine guns and artillery. This training included drills that simulated real combat scenarios, enhancing gunners’ reaction times and precision. Furthermore, specialized teams were assembled to ensure seamless communication between the personnel in charge of targeting systems and those operating the weapons.
Coordination among different military units was critical in effectively executing anti-aircraft defenses. Signals and reporting systems were developed to relay information regarding enemy aircraft movements swiftly. This ensured that anti-aircraft technology was employed efficiently, maximizing its effectiveness during air raids.Success rates against enemy aircraft varied, with reports suggesting that only a small percentage of targeted planes were successfully shot down. Factors such as range limitations, aiming difficulties, and the mobility of aircraft contributed to these lower success metrics. Despite these challenges, the development of barrage balloons created a physical barrier that could impede low-flying aircraft, thereby enhancing defensive measures.
However, the limitations of anti-aircraft technology were evident. Challenges included the rapid evolution of aircraft design and tactics, which often outpaced improvements in anti-aircraft systems. As a result, coordination between ground forces and aerial defenses was crucial but often hampered by inadequate training and communication during the war.</p></div></div></div>. This initiative reflects the broader recognition of drones as a critical threat on contemporary battlefields.
Training and coordination for anti-aircraft operations, particularly during conflicts such as World War I, laid the groundwork for current CUAS strategies.

Another example is in the protection of sensitive infrastructure, including airports and power plants. Anti-aircraft artillery, adapted for civilian use, provides a robust defense against hostile drone activities, safeguarding vital operations from surveillance or potential attacks. The ability to deploy precise countermeasures enhances the overall effectiveness against drones.</p></div></div></div>.

ConclusionEVOLVING SURVEILLANCE LAWS: BALANCING NATIONAL SECURITY AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY RIGHTS
By Abhilipsa Panda
The interplay between national security imperatives and the protection of individual privacy rights is important to everyone. The rapid advances in technologies, and the proliferation of data-driven intelligence activities, underscore the pressing need for robust legal frameworks that accord appropriate primacy to privacy rights. This article surveys the evolving legal landscape governing surveillance by the government when safeguarding national security prerogatives while upholding individual privacy rights.
The Evolution of Surveillance LawsThe evolution of surveillance laws necessitates heightened emphasis on the integration of enhanced data protection measures, cultivation of transparent oversight and accountability frameworks, and imposition of limitations on intrusive surveillance techniques. By prioritizing these privacy-centric legal considerations, policymakers can effectively uphold national security imperatives while safeguarding the foundational rights of individuals. Ongoing adaptations of legal frameworks should strive to foster an environment conducive to striking a balance between the imperatives of security and the protection of individual privacy amidst the backdrop of ever-evolving technological advancements and emergent security challenges.</p></div></div></div> Additionally, there is an ongoing tension between national security needs and individual privacy rights, making it imperative for policymakers to develop robust legal frameworks that safeguard both interests.<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[20]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [20]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Understanding International Drone Regulations for Safe Use </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://totalmilitaryinsight.com/international-drone-regulations/" target="_blank">https://totalmilitaryinsight.com/international-drone-regulations/</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>Adhering to pilot certification requirements enhances the safety and reliability of drone operations, thereby contributing to the overall efficacy of international drone regulations.

Furthermore, many systems only work on the mainstream consumer drones and are totally ineffective against homemade platforms that fall out the range of traditional radio frequency (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz) and guidance systems (direct link versus autonomous flight). Unfortunately, building a custom drone is relatively easy and does not require advanced technical knowledge. Legally, the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (NDAA) in December 2016 which gives authority to the Secretary of Defense to implement anti-drone measures to protect strategic military locations.Usually these different technologies are combined to offer detection and identification capabilities. Radar is well suited for detection while optical and infrared imaging give the operator a direct view of the object in order to confirm or dismiss the threat.
Neutralization: Destruction Versus Jamming- The Communications Act of 1934 “requires persons operating or using radio transmitters to be licensed or authorized under the Commission’s rules.” (47 U.S.C. § 301)
- The 47 C.F.R. Section 2.803 of the FCC “prohibits the manufacture, importation, marketing, sale or operation of these devices within the United States.”
- The U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. Section 1362) also “prohibits willful or malicious interference to U.S. government communications; subjects the operator to possible fines, imprisonment, or both.” This section could be applied to the GPS jammers.
Conclusion: The Level of Threat Versus Fear-MongeringThe first challenge is to detect and identify the threat. The difference between detection and identification is related to the level of accuracy and certainty. Detection is the ability to find and alert the presence of a threat. Identification is the capacity to classify the nature of the threat. For instance, the motion detection sensor of a home security system can detect a movement coming from a pet, a flapping window, or a person. Beyond that initial detection phase, the owner will need to check the security camera to identify the nature of the alarm: is this a cat or an intruder?
Below are the main detection and identification technologies.
Optical and InfraredUnfortunately, jamming is not operative against autonomous drones which follow pre-programmed routes via GPS waypoints (e.g., Pixhawk). Moreover, many custom-made drones can be fitted with different radio frequencies (72 Mhz, 433 MHz, 800/900 MHz, 1.2/1.3 GHz, etc.) to escape the scope of the drone guns. Jamming the GPS can be effective unless the drone is equipped with an inertial navigation system which allows the aircraft to navigate autonomously without the help external signals.
The Legal Issues
The jamming procedure is not exempt of problems due to its poor selectivity. Jamming also affects legitimate systems in the area as the FAA noted on October 2016 in a letter sent to airports:
Unauthorized UAS detection and counter measure deployments can create a host of problems, such as electromagnetic and Radio Frequency (RF) interference affecting safety of flight and air traffic management issues.</p></div></div></div><div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[1]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [1]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Anti-Drone Technology - Global Strategic Business Report </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4805109/anti-drone-technology-global-strategic" target="_blank">https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4805109/anti-drone-technology-global-strategic</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>- Future Trends and Drivers: Understand the key trends and drivers shaping the future of the Global Anti-Drone Technology Market.

The primary components of laser guns include:
- Laser Emitter: The laser emitter generates and focuses the laser beam.
- Beam Control System: The beam control system adjusts the direction and focus of the laser beam to accurately target the drone.
- Cooling System: The cooling system prevents overheating of the laser components during operation.
- Microwave Guns: Microwave guns emit high-frequency microwave radiation that can disrupt or damage the drone’s electronic systems. The primary components of microwave guns include:
- Microwave Emitter: The microwave emitter generates and directs the microwave radiation.
- Waveguide: The waveguide channels and focuses the microwave radiation towards the target.
- Power Source: The power source provides the energy needed to generate the microwave radiation.An anti-drone system is a set of technologies and strategies designed to detect, track, and neutralize or mitigate the threat posed by hostile or unauthorized drones. These systems are employed to protect sensitive areas, critical infrastructure, and high-profile events from potential drone-based threats. Anti-drone systems can be categorized into several types, each utilizing different technologies to achieve their objectives.
Types of Anti-Drone Systems
- Detection Systems
- Radar-Based Systems: These systems use radar to detect and track the movement of drones. They operate by emitting radio waves that bounce off objects, including drones. The reflected waves are then analyzed to determine the presence, speed, and trajectory of the drone.- Radio Frequency (RF) Scanners: RF scanners detect the electromagnetic signals emitted by drones during communication with their controllers. By analyzing these signals, RF scanners can identify the presence of drones and their operational frequency.
- Optical and Infrared Cameras: These systems use high-resolution cameras and thermal imaging to visually identify and track drones. Optical systems are particularly effective for detecting drones in clear conditions, while infrared cameras can detect heat signatures, making them useful in low-light or nighttime scenarios.
- Tracking Systems
- Acoustic Sensors: Acoustic sensors detect the sound of drone propellers and motors. By analyzing the sound signature, these systems can locate and track drones. They are often used in combination with other sensors for enhanced tracking accuracy.</p></div></div></div>.</p>

Furthermore, many systems only work on the mainstream consumer drones and are totally ineffective against homemade platforms that fall out the range of traditional radio frequency (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz) and guidance systems (direct link versus autonomous flight). Unfortunately, building a custom drone is relatively easy and does not require advanced technical knowledge. Legally, the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (NDAA) in December 2016 which gives authority to the Secretary of Defense to implement anti-drone measures to protect strategic military locations.Usually these different technologies are combined to offer detection and identification capabilities. Radar is well suited for detection while optical and infrared imaging give the operator a direct view of the object in order to confirm or dismiss the threat.
Neutralization: Destruction Versus Jamming- The Communications Act of 1934 “requires persons operating or using radio transmitters to be licensed or authorized under the Commission’s rules.” (47 U.S.C. § 301)
- The 47 C.F.R. Section 2.803 of the FCC “prohibits the manufacture, importation, marketing, sale or operation of these devices within the United States.”
- The U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. Section 1362) also “prohibits willful or malicious interference to U.S. government communications; subjects the operator to possible fines, imprisonment, or both.” This section could be applied to the GPS jammers.
Conclusion: The Level of Threat Versus Fear-MongeringThe first challenge is to detect and identify the threat. The difference between detection and identification is related to the level of accuracy and certainty. Detection is the ability to find and alert the presence of a threat. Identification is the capacity to classify the nature of the threat. For instance, the motion detection sensor of a home security system can detect a movement coming from a pet, a flapping window, or a person. Beyond that initial detection phase, the owner will need to check the security camera to identify the nature of the alarm: is this a cat or an intruder?
Below are the main detection and identification technologies.
Optical and InfraredUnfortunately, jamming is not operative against autonomous drones which follow pre-programmed routes via GPS waypoints (e.g., Pixhawk). Moreover, many custom-made drones can be fitted with different radio frequencies (72 Mhz, 433 MHz, 800/900 MHz, 1.2/1.3 GHz, etc.) to escape the scope of the drone guns.

Electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors can be used to detect drones depending on their visual and heat signatures. These sensors may need to be paired with machine vision and artificial intelligence algorithms that can reduce the risk of false positives and negatives.

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2 text-primary" id="kinetic-interception">Kinetic Interception</h3>
<p class="text-lg">Kinetic interception involves using projectiles, nets, or specialized anti-drone guns to physically disable or capture drones. This approach ensures the drone is neutralized without relying on electronic disruption methods<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[4]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [4]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The Technical and Legal Challenges of Anti-Drone Systems </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666" target="_blank">https://fstoppers.com/aerial/technical-and-legal-challenges-anti-drone-systems-193666</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>Most anti-drone systems combine several technologies such as radar for detection and optical camera for identification. Furthermore, many systems only work on the mainstream consumer drones and are totally ineffective against homemade platforms that fall out the range of traditional radio frequency (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz) and guidance systems (direct link versus autonomous flight). Unfortunately, building a custom drone is relatively easy and does not require advanced technical knowledge. Legally, the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (NDAA) in December 2016 which gives authority to the Secretary of Defense to implement anti-drone measures to protect strategic military locations.Usually these different technologies are combined to offer detection and identification capabilities. Radar is well suited for detection while optical and infrared imaging give the operator a direct view of the object in order to confirm or dismiss the threat.
Neutralization: Destruction Versus Jamming- The Communications Act of 1934 “requires persons operating or using radio transmitters to be licensed or authorized under the Commission’s rules.” (47 U.S.C. § 301)
- The 47 C.F.R. Section 2.803 of the FCC “prohibits the manufacture, importation, marketing, sale or operation of these devices within the United States.”
- The U.S. criminal code (18 U.S.C. Section 1362) also “prohibits willful or malicious interference to U.S. government communications; subjects the operator to possible fines, imprisonment, or both.” This section could be applied to the GPS jammers.
Conclusion: The Level of Threat Versus Fear-MongeringThe first challenge is to detect and identify the threat. The difference between detection and identification is related to the level of accuracy and certainty. Detection is the ability to find and alert the presence of a threat. Identification is the capacity to classify the nature of the threat. For instance, the motion detection sensor of a home security system can detect a movement coming from a pet, a flapping window, or a person. Beyond that initial detection phase, the owner will need to check the security camera to identify the nature of the alarm: is this a cat or an intruder?
Below are the main detection and identification technologies.
Optical and InfraredUnfortunately, jamming is not operative against autonomous drones which follow pre-programmed routes via GPS waypoints (e.g., Pixhawk). Moreover, many custom-made drones can be fitted with different radio frequencies (72 Mhz, 433 MHz, 800/900 MHz, 1.2/1.3 GHz, etc.) to escape the scope of the drone guns. Jamming the GPS can be effective unless the drone is equipped with an inertial navigation system which allows the aircraft to navigate autonomously without the help external signals.
The Legal Issues
The jamming procedure is not exempt of problems due to its poor selectivity. Jamming also affects legitimate systems in the area as the FAA noted on October 2016 in a letter sent to airports:
Unauthorized UAS detection and counter measure deployments can create a host of problems, such as electromagnetic and Radio Frequency (RF) interference affecting safety of flight and air traffic management issues.</p></div></div></div><div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[1]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [1]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Anti-Drone Technology - Global Strategic Business Report </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4805109/anti-drone-technology-global-strategic" target="_blank">https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4805109/anti-drone-technology-global-strategic</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>- Future Trends and Drivers: Understand the key trends and drivers shaping the future of the Global Anti-Drone Technology Market.

These technologies are crucial for addressing security, privacy, and public safety concerns arising from the widespread use of drones. Key components include radar systems, radio frequency detectors, and optical sensors that identify drone presence. Advanced solutions employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and response times. Countermeasures such as jamming, spoofing, and kinetic interception are used to disable or capture rogue drones.Mitigation systems neutralize unauthorized drones using various methods. Jamming systems emit radio frequency signals to disrupt the communication link between a drone and its operator, causing the drone to lose control. Spoofing systems send false GPS signals, confusing the drone and redirecting its flight path. Kinetic interception uses projectiles, nets, or anti-drone guns to physically disable or capture drones. Directed energy systems, like high-powered lasers or microwave weapons, disable drones by damaging their electronics. These methods, when combined, provide a comprehensive approach to countering different types of drone threats, enhancing the protection of sensitive areas from unauthorized drone activities.The hand-held and portable jammers seen in public reports look almost homemade. These basic jammers could be unsafe for the user. Their effectiveness is also uncertain. While signal jamming has been used since WWII, neutralizing drones today requires advanced technology. This includes sophisticated waveform and antenna design, effective jamming signals, and good heat dissipation.
Due to various issues affecting the Russian military-industrial sector, including degradation and compromises, Russian military systems often rely on imported commercial components. For instance, critical hardware in Orlan-10 drones incorporates components from China, Europe, and the U.S. Counter drone systems such as those by DroneShield, which are designed for commercial drones and components, are expected to be very effective in detecting and neutralizing such threats.Detection systems, utilizing various technologies, serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized drones by identifying them in specific areas. Radar-based systems use radio waves to detect and locate drones, providing real-time information about their position, speed, and altitude. These systems can distinguish between drones and other objects, such as birds, minimizing false alarms. RF detection systems monitor the radio frequencies used for drone communication and control. By analyzing these signals, they can identify drones and determine the location of their operators, particularly effective against commercially available drones using standard communication protocols. Acoustic sensors detect the unique sounds produced by drone motors and propellers, enabling real-time detection even in challenging environments. EO/IR cameras use optical and infrared imaging to detect and visually track drones, capturing high-resolution images and videos for identification</p></div></div></div>.</p>
