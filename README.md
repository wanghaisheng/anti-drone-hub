The search for academic papers on the effectiveness of anti-drone technology has provided insights into various applications and methodologies. One paper, "On the Effectiveness of UAS for Anti-Poaching in the African Arid Savanna," examines the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in anti-poaching efforts. The study conducted field tests to assess the visual and aural detection capabilities of UAVs against mock poachers, aiming to understand how UAVs can complement existing anti-poaching methods like camera traps and patrols. The research underscores the limited existing data on UAV effectiveness in this context, emphasizing the need for further studies [Larry Silverberg et al. (2019) On the Effectiveness of UAS for Anti-Poaching in the African Arid Savanna](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/05/660126.full.pdf).

Another study, "Using drones and sirens to elicit avoidance behaviour in white rhinoceros as an anti-poaching tactic," investigates the effectiveness of different deterrents to reduce rhino poaching. The research found that sirens and low-altitude drone flights were significantly more effective at eliciting avoidance behavior in rhinos compared to other stimuli like honeybees or scents. Drones were noted for their superior range and pursuit capabilities, suggesting they could be a promising, low-cost method for managing rhino movement in game reserves to combat poaching [Samuel G Penny et al. (2019) Using drones and sirens to elicit avoidance behaviour in white rhinoceros as an anti-poaching tactic](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.1135).

The paper "An Evaluation of the Factors Affecting ‘Poacher’ Detection with Drones and the Efficacy of Machine-Learning for Detection" evaluates the use of drones and machine learning for detecting poachers. It highlights the advantages of drones in surveying large areas and detecting nighttime activity, comparing the effectiveness of RGB and thermal infrared cameras. The study focuses on the factors influencing detection and the potential of machine learning to enhance poaching detection [Katie E. Doull et al. (2021) An Evaluation of the Factors Affecting ‘Poacher’ Detection with Drones and the Efficacy of Machine-Learning for Detection](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/12/4074/pdf).

Lastly, "SoK - Security and Privacy in the Age of Drones: Threats, Challenges, Solution Mechanisms, and Scientific Gaps" discusses the broader security and privacy threats posed by drones, including methods for detecting and disabling malicious drones. The authors review the effectiveness of various detection methods under different conditions and discuss the trade-offs between drone benefits and risks in populated areas, suggesting areas for future research [Ben Nassi et al. (2019) SoK - Security and Privacy in the Age of Drones: Threats, Challenges, Solution Mechanisms, and Scientific Gaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05155v1.pdf).

These studies collectively indicate that while anti-drone technologies show promise in various applications, their effectiveness can vary based on the specific context and the technology used. Further research is needed to refine these technologies and address the challenges they face.
